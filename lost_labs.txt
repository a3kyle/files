Level 1: Download and use software outside of the standard CentOS repos

The goal of this assignment is to teach students the absolute utility of the Linux terminal, also to enhance focus by showing how "harcker-y" they are.

1. install elinks
	a. elinks is a powerful text-based web browser for the linux terminal
	b. yum install elinks.x86_64
2. go onto your preferred browser when prompted, and then look up "vitetris"
3. download the linux tarball, and then expand it
4. go into the directory for vitetris, then type "make", then play the game by executing the binary
5. after you're done playing vitetris, go back into your home directory
6. enter "wget [link name here]", and then expand the tarball you get from it
7. type "make" after changing the directory to the file you got from expanding the tarball
8. execute the binary within that file, and then play myman, my maaaaan!

Evidence for Kyle:

1. check that elinks is installed by having the student enter "elinks"
2. check that vitetris is installed by having the student change the directory to the vitetris directory
3. check that vitetris works by having the student execute the binary
4. repeat 2 and 3 with myman instead of vitetris

Level 2 the midboss: Use git to clone github repositories
	Git is a powerful tool allowing you to downlad open-source software, as well as version control. If you are going into Computer Science, you will
	use Git (or at least something close to it) in order to manage group projects.

1. install/update git
	a. You know what to do.
2. use git to clone the git repository: [ENTER LINK HERE]
3. expand the tar file, then enter the directory that comes from it
4. follow the README instructions to install moon_buggy
5. run the moon_buggy binary, and have fun!

Evidence for Kyle:

1. check that git is installed by entering "git --help"
2. check that moon_buggy is installed by looking for the game directory 
3. check that the game was built properly by executing the binary

Level 3: SSH, THE FINAL BOSS!
	SSH is an encrypted network protocol which allows for secure communication over an insecure network.
1. install ssh if it isn't on your computer
2. check out ssh by connecting to ssh tron
	a. enter "ssh sshtron.zachlatta.com"
	b. play around with other classmates
